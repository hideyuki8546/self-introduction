### Martin Heidegger

Hello! My name is Martin Heidegger. I am 29 years old.
I am not a native speaker. Much like you, I also studied english from Junior Highschool. My mother-tongue is german. I come from the country-side of Austria where everybody has a strong dialect. When I finished my education my english was not any better than what I commonly hear in Japan.
The exchange with the international Open-Source community has helped me and my english skills a lot. Not just in regards to reading and writing but also with my speaking skills. These days I can communicate my thoughts fluently in english and I thought that maybe I can share some lessons with you!

### konitter

Hello, my name is konitter. I am 32 years old.
I am a project manager at NTT ADVERTISING in Osaka. I like to work with Excel, Powerpoint and Word to create some documents. I like to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am interested in front-end tools. An example is [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) or [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp).
I like opensource because I get feedback from various users.
