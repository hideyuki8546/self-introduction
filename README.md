### [@martinheidegger](https://github.com/martinheidegger)

Hello! My name is Martin HEIDEGGER. I am 29 years old.
I am not a native speaker. Much like you, I also studied english from Junior Highschool. My mother-tongue is german. I come from the country-side of Austria where everybody has a strong dialect. When I finished my education my english was not any better than what I commonly hear in Japan.
The exchange with the international Open-Source community has helped me and my english skills a lot. Not just in regards to reading and writing but also with my speaking skills. These days I can communicate my thoughts fluently in english and I thought that maybe I can share some lessons with you!
